# Algorithms and data structures

This is a repository in which are my practices with my own solutions to different exercises. The goal is to improve my way of solving different challenges that can place you in the job you want.

Also, I want to find the most optimal way and of course share my solutions to get feedback on them.

**If you have a more optimal or elegant way to solve one of the challenges in this repository and would like to share it...**

# The Project

- Each file contains a different challenge and has its own test file.
- It has its .eslintrc file so that we can follow some coding rules, avoid bad practices, correct syntax errors, etc...
- You have your .prettierrc file to format our code and make it easier to read.
- The tests are with jest and everything is written with typescript.
